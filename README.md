# Prisma

Prisma is a new programming language for Windows, designed to simplify programming, especially for German-speaking beginners. All commands are in German, and the language contains only the essential core commands: variables, outputs, conditions, and loops. Prisma currently supports setting variables with `set <name> to <value>`, outputs with `show "<text>"` or `show <variable>`, conditions with `if <condition> then ... else ... end`, and loops with `repeat while <condition> ... end`. Examples: `set x to 5`, `show "Hello World"`, `if x greater than 3 then show "x is greater than 3" else show "x is less than or equal to 3" end`, `repeat while x less than 10 show x set x to x + 1 end`.



` ... To install Prisma, download the installer from the Releases section, run the `.exe` file, and follow the instructions (Next → Accept license → Finish). After installation, Prisma can be used on your Windows system. The repository contains sample scripts in `.pris` format that can be run directly with Prisma to test the language. Extensions to the Prisma source code are welcome, but please credit the author and inform them. For questions or problems, please contact **aufderheide888@gmail.com**.
